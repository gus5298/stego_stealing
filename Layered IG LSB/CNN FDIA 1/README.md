# Image Analysis and Visualization with Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs image processing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning-based visual interpretation. It is designed for experiments involving saliency detection, pixel importance visualization, and model behavior understanding.

## Features

- Grayscale image processing using OpenCV and scikit-image
- Statistical analysis with pandas and NumPy
- Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
- Machine learning and deep learning with scikit-learn and TensorFlow
- Interpretability using tf-keras-vis for saliency and activation maps

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.kit.edu/gustavo.collado/steganography/-/tree/main/Layered%20IG%20LSB/CNN%20FDIA%201
   cd image-analysis-visualization
