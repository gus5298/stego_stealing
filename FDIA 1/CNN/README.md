# 🧠 CNN-Based Steganography on FDIA 1 Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements and evaluates a CNN-based steganography pipeline on the FDIA 1 dataset.

The notebook has already been **fully executed**, and all results (e.g., training logs, evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and image quality scores) are **saved and visible**.  
There is **no need to retrain the model or rerun any code** to view the results.

## 📓 Notebook

- **`CNN_FDIA1_Results.ipynb`**  
  A complete notebook with:
  - CNN model architecture and training
  - Steganographic embedding and extraction
  - Image quality analysis (PSNR, SSIM, MSE, etc.)
  - Evaluation results (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.)

## 📊 Results Included

- ✅ Training Accuracy & Loss  
- ✅ Confusion Matrix  
- ✅ Classification Report  
- ✅ PSNR, SSIM, MSE  
- ✅ Stego image visualizations (if applicable)

All outputs are embedded directly into the notebook.
